# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### CI / Build

- Bump cargo-dist to v0.30.2 in release workflow. ([#7](https://github.com/jpreagan/llmnop/pull/7))

## 0.3.0

Released on 2025-10-27

### Added

- `--tokenizer` CLI flag to allow a different tokenizer name than the served model name (e.g., `--model gpt-oss:20b --tokenizer openai/gpt-oss-20b`). Also writes `tokenizer` into the summary JSON and bumps the summary schema version field to `2025-10-05`. ([#1](https://github.com/jpreagan/llmnop/pull/1))

### Changed

- Default `--max-num-completed-requests` from 1 â†’ 2, so two completions can be handled out of the box. ([#3](https://github.com/jpreagan/llmnop/pull/3))
- Dependency refresh; `tokenizers` now built with `rustls-tls` (no OpenSSL dependency). ([#4](https://github.com/jpreagan/llmnop/pull/4))

### CI / Build

- Upgrade `cargo-dist` to v0.30; enable shell + Homebrew installers; use `$XDG_BIN_HOME` / `~/.local/bin` install paths; docs refreshed. ([#2](https://github.com/jpreagan/llmnop/pull/2))

### Notes
